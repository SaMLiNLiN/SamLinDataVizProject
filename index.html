<h1>NBA SMALL BALL ERA (Golden State Warriors)</h1>
<p>
    The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional
    basketball league that was founded in the United States in 1949.
    It consists of 82 games in the regular season, and 
    playoff series depending on how far each team gets. 
    There has been different eras in the history of the NBA. 
    However, we will be focusing on the transition from the 
    Transitional Era (1955 - 2013) to the Modern Era of the NBA (since 2013).
    We will be specifically focusing on the small ball playing style adopted by 
    the Golden State Warriors (GSW), which started in approximately 2010-2011 
    season until around 2019-2020 season. During this period of time, it is evident
     that there was a change in playing time of each position, the salaries of 
    each player, and the number of Champions each team won to show the effectiveness
    of the adoption of the small ball style of basketball of the GSW.

                <br> <br>
                In this bar chart, we can see that in comparison to before the small
                ball era (2010-2011), the average playing time of both the Point guards
                and Small Forwards, in the team Golden State Warriors, has increased by approximately 
                8 mins during the beginning of the Small Ball Era (2014- 2015). 
                <br> <br>
                However, something to note here is that the average playing time of a shooting guard 
                has decreased. This is due to the fact that the roster for this season contains a lot
                more shooting guards in the team (4 in total out of 15), therefore, when averaging the playing time
                it turns out to be lower as some shooting guards has less avg playing time. That being
                said, if we were to only look at Klay Thompson (the main SG for this team), he actually played 
                an avg of 31.9 mins, which is the second highest (just a bit under the star player / point guard: Stephen Curry).

                         In these node link charts, we can see that the top three paid 
                         players are: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins as their 
                         links are the four most thickest edges. (check table view).
                         <br> <br>
                         As illustrated, the highest paying positions are PG and two SFs, 
                         which shows supports the idea showed in the bar chart to 
                         the right. However, something to note here is that Klay Thompson has switched 
                         from being a SG to a SF, but this doesn't really affect his "position" on the 
                         court. To clarify, GSW often go with a lineup with 2 SFs(for example, have Thompson 
                         and Wiggins both play but have
                         one playing the PF and the other plyaing the SF, but they can 
                         play interchangably). Looking at the chart, it 
                         is evident that GSW put more emphasis on the PG and SF position with a higher salary.

            NOTE: hover over colored states to see list of Champions

             In this map we can see some states are colored. The deeper the color,
             the more champions the teams in that state won.

             As presented in the map 
             CA has the most champions from the seasons 2011 - 2022. When we hover over it
             we can also see that the Warriors has won the champion 4 out of the 12 seasons! This shows an 
             extreme success in the change of style for the Warriors as they focus more on players that play the 
             point guard, shooting guard, or small forward. However, this doesn't guarantee that 
             the small ball style will continually bring success to the Warriors because styles of basketball 
             changes over time as players move around to different teams and new rookies enter the league.
             That being said, the small ball style has brought success the the Warriors in the past decade, 
             but there will be changed to the league in the soon future, so the small ball era might come to an end sometime soon.

    <h2>Summary: </h2>
    <p> After observing the three visualizations above, we can clearly see that adopting the small ball style 
        has affected the GSW in terms of playing time for different positions, the salaries for different players
        and their corresponding positions, and lastly, the success of this style of basketball (focusing on PG, SG, SF) has been proven by the nubmer of 
        championships won by the GSW in the past couple of seasons. In conclusion, the GSW is one of the most significant teams
        that adopted the small ball style successfully, and this has changed the league and the game of basketball as many young players 
        starting from the youth level look up to these basketball stars and mimic their style of baseketball. That being said, 
        the adoption of small ball style is a huge historical transition / era of basketball, 
        and it has definintly created a huge impact in the game of basketball as well as marked a significant moment in the history 
        of basketball!
